## Languages and Technologies

JavaScript, Plotly.js, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask were the languages and technologies used to build the Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard. 

After the data was analyzed, the graphs were built using Plotly and JavaScript. The pie chart shows the top ten samples for a particular sample id.  

The bubble chart shows all the samples and OTU ID data points. Metadata for the sample is also displayed, along with a gauge chart for weekly washing frequency.
